# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Overview of Project:
This analysis project was brought to me by Louise, who is an up and coming playwrite.  Louise found and plans to use a crowdfunding platform called Kickstarter which exists to help bring creative projects to life by allowing others to help fund creative projects.  She plans to raise funds to launch a play that she has written called, "Fever".  Louise asked for help in identifying factors that led to other campaigns being successful as well as factors that led to unsuccessful campaigns.  She created a budget for her play and needed to raise $12,000 to see her work come to life.

### Purpose:
Upon reviewing the data from Kickstarter campaigns, Louise came close to raising her campaign fundraising goal.  She is now curious how launch dates and funding goals affect the success of a campaign.  This analysis will take a look at the data to gain some insight into the questions that Louise has about launch dates and funding goals.  

## Analysis and Challenges:

The data set that was provided for this project contained information relating to just over 4,100 crowdfunding campaigns that are using Kickstarter to raise funds.  The data set provided information on the funding goal of each campaign as well as the funding amount raised.  There were campaigns from all over the world and also in a wide variety of categories.  The categories were divided into fields such as film, music, games, technology, and theater among others.  The data also provided information about the launch date and number of backers who contributed to the campaign.  

The data provided information that allowed further insight by calculating the percentage funded as well as average donation amount.  The categories were broken out further into subcategories so that we coul drill down the data to gain insights from theater campaigns for Louis. The theater campaigns were further filtered to show only campaigns in the United States instead of globally.  There were a total of 912 theater campaigns with 525 successful campaigns for a success rate of 57.6%.  The data was then analyzed by the play subcategory which resulted in 671 total play campaigns of which 412 or 61.4% were successful in raising their goal for funding.       

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The following chart shows the Outcomes Based on Launch Date:

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results
#### What are two conclusions you can draw abou the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

#### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

#### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
