# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Overview of Project:
This analysis project was brought to me by Louise, who is an up and coming playwrite.  Louise found and plans to use a crowdfunding platform called Kickstarter which exists to help bring creative projects to life by allowing others to help fund creative projects.  She plans to raise funds to launch a play that she has written called, "Fever".  Louise asked for help in identifying factors that led to other campaigns being successful as well as factors that led to unsuccessful campaigns.  She created a budget for her play and needed to raise $10,000 to see her work come to life.

### Purpose:
Upon reviewing the data from Kickstarter campaigns, Louise came close to raising her campaign fundraising goal.  She is now curious how launch dates and funding goals affect the success of a campaign.  This analysis will take a look at the data to gain some insight into the questions that Louise has about launch dates and funding goals.  

## Analysis and Challenges:

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results
#### What are two conclusions you can draw abou the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

#### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

#### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
